# Airbnb Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings data to extract insights related to pricing, availability, and neighborhood characteristics.
The analysis follows a complete data analytics pipeline starting from data loading and cleaning, moving through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic modeling.

All Arabic comments and markdown text inside the notebook were converted into English to make the project suitable for academic and professional use.
